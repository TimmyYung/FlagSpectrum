# [FlagSpectrum](https://flagspectrum.vercel.app/)
## Description
This is a web-based game for players to generate prompts that describe a relationship dynamic and a personality trait (e.g., "Child: Shares memes with you") . Players then classify the prompt as either a Red Flag, Green Flag, or Beige Flag (quirky/neutral trait). The app is designed for fun discussions and debates about relationships and personality quirks, making it great for parties, icebreakers, or casual play. 
## How to Play
1. Open the website in your mobile browser
2. Click on the "Generate Prompt" button to receive a random relationship description and personality trait.
3. Each player silently selects their flag by pressing one of the color-coded buttons in the top-left corner: 
    - Red Flag: A negative or undesirable trait.
    - Green Flag: A positive or desirable trait.
    - Beige Flag: A neutral or quirky trait.
4. Once all players have made their selections, everyone reveals their choice at the same time.
5. Discuss your reasoning for your choice with the group. Compare answers and debate whether certain traits are dealbreakers, positives, or neutral quirks.
